# TestFlex

TestFlex is a dependency inversion layer for your unit test code. Import the runner you want, use it, and then switch the runner as you see fit.

Running Jest but want to try Bun? Maybe the Node.js test runner? What happens when Jest falls out of favour and we need to move away from it? TestFlex can help prevent this from being an issue, while allowing you to gain the performance benefits of another test framework.
